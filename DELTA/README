This is a version of the genome code that will run on the delta.

It will also run on the gamma with one modification.   To run it on the
Gamma, a line in main3c.f has to be
changed.  It must have include 'fcube.h' instead of 'fmesh.f'.  The host
and the node are the same program.  It knows weather to act as a host or
not depending if it is on node 0.  A file called Gammastart is in the Delta
directory.  In runs the code once you have run getcube to get some nodes.
It will release them if it terminates normally.
