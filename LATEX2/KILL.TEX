\section{Killing a DQS Job}

If a user decides that one of his jobs is no longer necessary, he can
delete the job from the queuing system.  The command for doing this is
the {\bf qdel} command.  Only the owner of a job, or a manager of the
DQS system can delete a job from DQS.  The syntax for this operation
is :
\begin{verbatim}
qdel jobnumber
\end{verbatim}
Where jobnumber is the number of the job that is to be killed.

The jobnumber is returned by the \qsub command when a job is submitted.  If
the user forgets the number for the job, it can be obtained by the \qstat
command.  It is useful to know that every job is named jobnumber.scriptfile
where scriptfile is the name of the job script file that was submitted.
