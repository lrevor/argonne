\section{Reconstruction}

Due to various delays, the actual algorithm for the 
reconstruction of the simulated genome has not yet been developed.
However, the research presented in this paper has lead to a better
understanding of the problem.
Once the algorithm is completed and tested,
the code to generate the genome (and table data), as well as the code for
the reconstruction, must be altered to allow for experimental errors.  Out
of all the tasks mentioned thus far, I predict that this last step
mentioned shall be the most difficult.
