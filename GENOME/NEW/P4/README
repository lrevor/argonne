This P4 version of the genome project was written using the Gamma version
in the directory /GAMMA/GENOME1.  To compile for use on the suns, use make
mainc.  Alter the file procgroup to contain the workstations you wish it to
run on.

For documentation for this version, see the basic version in /GENOME/NEW
under mainc.

A version of the genome code has been written that is better suited for P4.
It is in the /DELTA directory.  I think that it will run better than this
version if it is converted to P4.
