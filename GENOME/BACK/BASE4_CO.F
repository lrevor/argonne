C     THIS FUNCTION IS TO ACCEPT A STRING AS INPUT, AND CONVERT IT TO A 
C       BASE 10 NUMBER.  THE STRING IS TO BE IN BASE 4 FORMAT WITH LETTERS
C       REPRESENTING THE NUMBERS.  THE LETTERS SHALL REPRESENT NUMBERS AS 
C       FOLLOWS.  A = 0, T = 1, C = 2, G = 3.  THEREFORE, THE INPUT OF

C       'ABCD' WOULD RESULT IN THE OUTPUT OF 27 - BECAUSE 0123 BASE 4 IS
C       EQUAL TO 27 BASE 10.
