The subdirectories GENOME1 and GENOME2 contain two different version of the
genome code.

Genome1 contains a version whose host (generation of the table and control
over the nodes) runss on the frant end of the gamma.  The host and node are
two separate programs.

Genome2 contains a version whose host runs on a node of the gamma itself.
In this version the host and node programs are different programs as well.

A better version was created when looking to run on the delta.  It is in
the directoy /DELTA.  To run it on the Gamma, a line in main3c.f has to be
changed.  It must have include 'fcube.h' instead of 'fmesh.f'.  The host
and the node are the same program.  It knows weather to act as a host or
not depending if it is on node 0.  A file called Gammastart is in the Delta
directory.  In runs the code once you have run getcube to get some nodes.
It will release them if it terminates normally.
